This project was created as part of Udacity's Front End Nanodegree program. The project is to utilize Jasmine testing. 

To use the program, click the hamburger menu at the top left of the screen and choose a particular feed. 
Once you choose a feed you can then click on a specific blog post and read about that topic. 

You can change to a new feed at any time by clicking the hamburger menu again. 

I hope you enjoy it!
